# Doduko
This Java program solves Sudoku using a backtracking algorithm. It includes methods to check if placing a number is safe, recursively solve the puzzle, initiate solving, and print the grid. The `main` method reads a 9x9 puzzle from input (0 for empty cells), solves it, and prints the result or states if no solution exists.
