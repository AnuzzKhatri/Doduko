This Java program is designed to solve Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm, encapsulated within the 'Solution' class. The class includes several methods to manage various aspects of the puzzle-solving process. The 'isSafe' method ensures that a given number can be placed in a specific cell without violating Sudoku rules by checking the numberâ€™s presence in the current row, current column, and the 3x3 subgrid that contains the cell. The 'helper' method is a recursive function that attempts to solve the Sudoku puzzle by placing numbers from 1 to 9 in empty cells. It identifies the next cell to move to after placing a number and recursively tries to solve the remainder of the puzzle. If placing a number leads to a dead end, the function backtracks by resetting the cell to 0 and tries the next possible number.
The 'solveSudoku' method initiates the solving process by invoking the 'helper' method, starting from the top-left cell (0, 0). It verifies whether the Sudoku puzzle can be solved and prints the solved puzzle if successful; otherwise, it prints a message indicating that no solution exists. The 'printSudoku' method formats and prints the Sudoku grid, making it easy to visualize the solved puzzle. The 'main' method serves as the entry point of the program. It uses a 'Scanner' object to read the 9x9 Sudoku puzzle from user input, where empty cells are represented by 0. After reading the puzzle, it calls the 'solveSudoku' method to solve and print the puzzle.
